  "Interactive functions to aid the development of Palm Pre apps.

This package is in Early Beta, (they did just release the SDK).
I am open to any contributions or ideas.  For now just post on
the Emacs Wiki, but soon there will be a spot on github for it.")
  
;;; Installation:
;; Put mojo.el somewhere in your load-path.
;; (Use M-x show-variable RET load-path to see what your load path is.)
;; Add this to your Emacs init file.
;(require 'mojo)
;; Make sure you customize the variables:
;; `mojo-project-directory' and `mojo-sdk-directory'

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below are complete command list:
;;
;;  `mojo-generate'
;;    Generate a new Mojo application in the `mojo-project-directory'.
;;  `mojo-emulate'
;;    Launch the palm emulator.
;;  `mojo-package'
;;    Package up an application inside of DIR.
;;  `mojo-install'
;;    Install PACKAGE.  The emulator needs to be running.
;;  `mojo-list'
;;    List all installed packages.
;;  `mojo-delete'
;;    Remove application named APP-NAME.
;;  `mojo-launch'
;;    Launch application APP-NAME in an emulator.
;;  `mojo-close'
;;    Close launched application APP-NAME.
;;  `mojo-inspect'
;;    Run the dom inspector on APP-NAME.
;;  `mojo-hard-reset'
;;    Perform a hard reset, clearing all data.
;;
;;; Customizable Options:

;; Below are customizable option list:
;;
;;  `mojo-sdk-directory'
;;    Path to where the mojo SDK is.
;;    default = (case system-type ((windows-nt) "c:/progra~1/palm/sdk") (t ""))
;;  `mojo-project-directory'
;;    Directory where all your Mojo projects are located.
;;    default = ""
;;  `mojo-debug'
;;    Run Mojo in debug mode.  Assumed true while in such an early version.
;;    default = t
